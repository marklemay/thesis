The cast language
Dependent types theory is intimately tied to And internal notion of equality because Types can depend on terms and functions need to decide if a type is appropriate when a term we must have a way to characterize term level of quality.
The usual way to handle this by adding qualities to the theory...
In a logically sound type theory we can add all proofs provable internal to the theory to get Extensional Type theory.
Todo give the rule and example




The cast language extends the surface language with casts were everything they can go wrong 

Is localized to a single construct
The cast language supports

The cast of the type form a limited nondeterminism.This is a little awkward since we cannot directly imply to terms or equal to each other. However it turns out to be Difficult to build quality checks into the term level we attended this several times but it is hard to build reasonable typing rules since equal terms may have different types
