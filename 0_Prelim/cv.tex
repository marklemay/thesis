\section*{Areas of Interest}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Primarily interested in type theory, formal methods, theorem proving technologies, and software engineering practices.
  \item Have some experience with computer graphics, machine learning, and web development.
\end{itemize}

% Basically, this needs to be worked out by each individual, however the same format, margins, typeface, and type size must be used as in the rest of the dissertation.
