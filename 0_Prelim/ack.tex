Boston University is an excellent school to learn Computer Science.
It is so full of intelligent, passionate, and kind people that any list of people will feel incomplete.
Given that I especially want to thank Dr.(!) Tomislav Petrovic his wife Ana and their adorably strong willed children for the longest friendship at BU;
Qiancheng Fu, Cheng Zhang, and William Blair for their discussions, collaborations and friendship;
and my advisor Dr. Hongwei Xi who has been more supportive than I would have thought possible.
Also he is a genius.
Finally to the administrators (especially Kori MacDonald) who have always managed to get paperwork where it is needed to go in spite of me.

My family has also supported, encouraged and tolerated this thesis process.
Matt Lemay and his wife Alex and their dog Lilly were always ready to provide a needed destraction and encouragement\footnote{``Cs get degrees bro''}.
My parents Bob and Carol Lemay also need to be thanked for their support.
