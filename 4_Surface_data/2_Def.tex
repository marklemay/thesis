\section{Data}

%What data defs/ constructors
% The langugae defined in this thesus uses data definitions like those found in systems like Agda and Coq. 

A dependent data type is defined by a type constructor indexed by
arguments, and a set of data constructors that tag data and characterize
their arguments. Several familiar data types are defined in Figure
\ref{fig:data-defs}. For example, the data type $\mathtt{Nat}$ is
is defined with the type constructor $\mathtt{Nat}$ (which has no
type arguments), the data constructors $\mathtt{Z}$ which takes no
further information and the data constructor $\mathtt{S}$ which is
formed with the prior number. The data type $\mathtt{Vec}$ has two
type arguments corresponding to the the type contained in the vector
and its length, it has two data constructors that allow building an
empty vector, or to add an element to the front of an existing vector.

Data defined in this style is simple to build and reason about, since
data can only be created from its constructors. Unfortunately the
details of data elimination are a little more involved.

data Bool : * {
| True : Bool

data Nat : * {
| Z : Nat
| S : Nat -> Nat
};
three : Nat;
three = S (S (S Z)));
-- Syntactic sugar allows 3 = S (S (S Z)))

data Vec : (A : *) -> Nat -> * {
| Nil  : (A : *) -> Vec A Z
| Cons : (A : *) -> A -> (x : Nat)
        -> Vec A x -> Vec A (S x)
};

someBools : Vec Bool 2;
someBools = Cons Bool True 1 (Cons Bool False 0 (Nil Bool));

data Id : (A : *) -> A -> A -> * {
| refl  : (A : *) -> (a : A) -> Id A a a
};

threeEqThree : Id Nat three three;
threeEqThree = refl Nat three;
