%Surprisingly, the \csys{} can be extended with a pattern matching construct without unification.
\Ch{3} showed how to use the \ac{TAS} and the \bidir{} system as a guide to build a dependently typed language with runtime equality.
The \ac{TAS} inspired the \csys{}, where the properties and lemmas of the \ac{TAS} can be extended with casts.
While the \bidir{} system suggested how to localize uncertain assumptions that can be repurposed by elaboration as equality checks.
 
In this Chapter we will extend these systems for dependently indexed data and pattern matching.
This will turn out to be more complicated than the system in \ch{3}, for two reasons.
First, equality was only testable at types in \ch{3} which allowed for some syntactic and semantic shortcuts.
In the presence of dependent data, equality needs to be testable at terms, which will not necessarily have the same type.
Second, the subtleties of pattern matching will need to be dealt with.
While the intuition built up in \ch{3} still holds, the \clang{} will need to be revised.

As before, we will take the (conjectured) \slang{} of \ch{4} and construct a \clang{} with corresponding features.
Though it is difficult to formalize a \ac{TAS} and corresponding \bidir{} system that has pattern matching, we will assume the unification of pattern matching belongs in the \bidir{} system since it exists only to establish static correctness and is not needed for evaluation.
Accordingly we will extend elaboration with a form of unification.
Because we will not need to deal with unification in the \clang{}, the \clang{} can provide evidence that the \csys{} is \textbf{cast sound}. \todo{"show" if we ever get a proof}
While the lack of a formal \ac{TAS} and \bidir{} system in \ch{4} will make the other properties of \ch{3} impossible to prove here, we will design the system with an eye towards preserving them.

% \todo{formulate case consistently}
% Elaboration should satisfy the additional correctness\todo{``gradual correctness''?} properties relative to a type assignment system and \bidir{} system.
% In this case we will target the conjectured TAS from Chapter 4, with a first order unification style pattern matching.

Despite these caveats, there is an interesting interpretation of data and pattern matching when extended to the \csys{}.

In a conventionally typed language, the normal forms of data terms have a valid data constructor in the head position (justifying the syntax of pattern matching).
In the \clang{}, the normal form of data can have casts applied to an expression.
If the casts are blameless then the constructor in the head position will match the data type.
% Casts are wrapped around terms during the elaboration procedure, and will accumulate during evaluation.
In the \clang{} pattern matching is extended with a path variable that can represent evidence of equality, then that evidence can be extracted and used in the body of the branch.
\todo{needs an example figure?}

As in conventional pattern matching, since the type constructor is known, it is possible to check the coverage against all possible constructors.
If every constructor is accounted for, only blameable \scruts{} are possible.
Quantifying over evidence of equality allows blame to be redirected, so if the program gets stuck in a pattern branch it can blame the original faulty assumption.

To account for ``unreachable patterns'' that are not stated in the \slang, we can record the proof of inequality for use at runtime.
Since in the \clang{}, it is possible for a \case{} expression to reduce into one of those ``unreachable'' branches.
If this happens blame will be reflected back onto a specific problematic assumption made by the \scrut{}.
This will involve extending the \clang{} with operations to manipulate equality evidence directly.
Proofs of inequality will be able to appear in terms.
 
% During elaboration, after a pattern is unified, we will inject the proofs of equality where needed so that they cast check. 
% This will require that our notion of paths support congruence.

%   \item How do sameness assertions cast check? This is difficult, because

\section{Prior Work}
% The work in this Chapter is original, and th
There is very little prior work that can be cited for this Chapter.
 
While univalent type theories are interested in tracking (possibly unique) equalities over data, those systems tend to make users deal with equalities explicitly.
Since the goal here is an easy to use language, their approach did not seem applicable.
% The theory of those systems also
 
The most relevant work to this Chapter is \cite{10.1145/3495528}, which uses a gradual typing methodology to gradualize a version of the \ac{CIC}.
Their are a number of relevant differences between these works:
That work needs to support a term level wildcard $?$, where this chapter maintains the surface syntax.
This Chapter supports fully indexed data, that work only supported parameterized data.

\section{Future Work}

The system presented here improves on several earlier systems and implementation experiments.
There is reason to believe things could be improved further.
For instance, when pattern matching an uncast data the pattern must have a cast variable (so one is synthesized).
It may be more efficient (and cleaner) to have a term that would correspond to reflexivity, as some of our earlier experimental systems had.
% \todo[inline]{Nullery ops}

Currently the implementation is fairly consevative with pattern matches.
Only variables that appear in \case{} patterns are used as flexible variables for unification.
This results in some unintuitive behavior, such as needing to pattern match on the length of the list in $\mathtt{append}$.
\begin{lstlisting}[basicstyle={\ttfamily\small}]
append : (A : *) -> (n : Nat) -> Vec A n
 -> (m : Nat) -> Vec A m
 -> Vec A (add n m) ;
append A n vn m vm =
 case n, vn < n' => _ : Vec A n' => Vec A (add n' m) >{
   | (Z)   => (Nil _) => vm
   | (S _) => (Cons _ a pn pvn)
     => Cons A a (add pn m) (append A pn pvn m vm)
 };
\end{lstlisting}
% For now this seems sensible since if $n$ is not on the scrutinee list, we will not even know if it is a \Nat{}.
In \ch{4} we noted that there are different ways one could handle flexible variables in type checking.
But elaboration opens up new possibilities.
For instance, we have enough information that the elaborator could add $n$ to the scrutinee list, and refine the pattern appropriately.

% Make equalities visible in the surface syntax
The system here hints at an extension to pattern matching syntax that could be explored more generally. 
It seems useful to be able to read equational information out of patterns, especially in settings with rich treatment of equality.
Matching equalities directly could be a useful feature in Agda, or in univalent type theories where manipulating equations is more critical.% such as CTT.
